Fix bug where FOLIAGE_LEFT and FOLIAGE_RIGHT literal characters are being printed in tree output instead of proper foliage characters (lines 109, 211).\n\n2. Fix logic that prevents consecutive ornaments around lines 120-121 where spacing rules may not be properly enforced.\n\n3. Rule: No 2 ornaments can be consecutive (at least one foliage between them). This applies to both initial tree generation and randomizeDecorations function.\n\n4. Ensure spacing logic correctly tracks previous ornament state and prevents adjacency across both decoration placement and animation updates.","status":"in_progress","priority":3,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2026-01-11T13:19:08.417Z","updated_at":"2026-01-11T13:20:52.320Z","parent_id":"cell--ppd4r-mk9rfzt3tkh","dependencies":[],"labels":[],"comments":[]}
